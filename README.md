### How We Did It

Our team developed a **Gradient Boosting Regression model** to predict **DC (direct current) output** based on various environmental and solar parameters.  
We began by analyzing correlations between features such as **solar radiation, UV index, wind chill, and temperature**, identifying the most influential variables.  

After testing multiple models â€” including **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** â€” we selected **Gradient Boosting Regressor** with parameter manipulation for its superior accuracy and ability to capture nonlinear relationships.  

The model was trained using an 80/20 train-test split, achieving an **RÂ² score of 0.98** on the test data, **only 0.00001 accuracy off of first place**. No usage of generative AI assistants were permitted in the competition.
